title: Exceptions

We have a lot of exceptions for different situations.
They are split into different subclasses for `ConnectionPool`, `Connection`, `Transaction` and `Cursor`.

You can use them to define code behavior based on exceptions.

All exceptions described [here](https://github.com/psqlpy-python/psqlpy/blob/main/python/psqlpy/_internal/exceptions.pyi)
